# Project 3 - *Flixter Part 1*

**Flixter** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] (6pts) **Make a request to [The Movie Database API's `now_playing`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing) endpoint to get a list of current movies**
- [X] (6pts) **Parse through JSON data and implement a RecyclerView to display all movies**
- [X] (6pts) **Use Glide to load and display movie poster images**

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [X] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [X] Implement orientation responsivity
  - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [X] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading
  - Note: this feature is difficult to capture in a GIF without throttling internet speeds.  Instead, include an additional screencap of your Glide code implementing the feature.  (<10 lines of code)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Show an emoticon for each movie, where it will be sad :( if the rating was bad, :/ if was soso, and happy :) if it has a good rating

## Notes

It was an amazing app to learn, my biggest challenge was work with the API. Moreover, in my code are a lot of things that should be optimized like the Map that I'm using in Movies.java, I should find a way to make it an attribute not an static Map.
